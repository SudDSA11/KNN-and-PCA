# KNN-and-PCA
Explored KNN on the Wine dataset, tested feature scaling, distance metrics, and PCA for dimensionality reduction. Compared accuracies on original vs PCA-transformed data, visualized variance, and demonstrated a robust pipeline for high-dimensional biomedical data using PCA + KNN for interpretable, efficient classification.
